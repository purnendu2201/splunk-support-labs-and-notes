# Splunk Support Labs & Notes

This repository contains my **hands-on Splunk practice labs**, **troubleshooting experiments**, and **learning notes** as I grow as a Splunk Support Engineer.

The goal of this repo is to document:
- What I practice  
- What issues I investigate  
- What I learn every week  
- How I approach Splunk troubleshooting  

All examples and logs are **generic** and not based on real customer data.
